# projectx-grpc

Project Name : Health check portal

Tech Used : gRPC


Develop an understanding of gRPC which is a modern open source high performance RPC framework that can run in any environment. It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication. It is also applicable in last mile of distributed computing to connect devices, mobile applications and browsers to backend services. It uses protocol buffers for its message payloads.


Develop a simple UI for RPC services. The users should be able to  

·          Send requests to a gRPC service.

·          Upload your proto files, select a service, configure your message, and send a request.

·          Support all the streaming capabilites of gRPC i.e unidirectional and bidirectional communication.

·         Should have an automatic health check for each registered service to check whether the service is up or down

·          Keeps a record of your outgoing and incoming messages.

·          The client and the services should be written using two different languages to demonstrate cross language support.
